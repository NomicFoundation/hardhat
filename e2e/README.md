### Hardhat initialization tests this is a test

To run the "hardhat init" tests, use the command:

```
./test-project-initialization.sh
```

### All other Hardhat scenario tests

To run all the fixture tests, use the command:

```
./run-fixture-projects.sh
```

You can run a single project's tests by passing the project folder name as a parameter.

Example: to run only the tests inside the `vars` folder, use:

```
./run-fixture-projects.sh vars
```
