# Testing contracts

In this guide, we will explore the testing of smart contracts with Buidler. For a general overview of using Buidler refer to the [Getting started guide](/guides/#getting-started).

The built-in task `test` allows smart contracts to be tested using Mocha, and the testing framework of your choice.

For compatibility purposes with other JavaScript tools, Buidler injects the properties in the [Buidler Runtime Environment] into the global scope when running tests. Let's create a new sample project to see how this plays out.

Run these to start:
```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm init --yes
npm install @nomiclabs/buidler
```

Now run `npx buidler` inside your project folder and create a sample project. This is what the file structure should look like once you're done:

```
$ ls -l
total 296
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff     195 Aug  8 15:04 buidler.config.js
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Aug  8 15:04 contracts
drwxr-xr-x  378 fzeoli  staff   12096 Aug  7 16:12 node_modules
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff  139778 Aug  7 16:12 package-lock.json
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff     294 Aug  7 16:12 package.json
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Aug  8 15:04 scripts
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Aug  8 15:04 test
```

If you look at the file `test/sample-test.js`, you'll find this sample test:

```js
const assert = require("assert");

describe("Ethereum provider", function() {
  it("Should return the accounts", async function() {
    const accounts = await ethereum.send("eth_accounts");
    assert(accounts.length !== 0, "No account was returned");
  });
});
```

Which is a vanilla [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test that you can run by running `npx buidler test`
```
$ npx buidler test
All contracts have already been compiled, skipping compilation.


  Ethereum provider
    ✓ Should return the accounts (104ms)


  1 passing (113ms)
```

Now, if you look closely at the test, you can see that in this line:
```js
const accounts = await ethereum.send("eth_accounts");
```

the `ethereum` object is being accessed from the global scope. It's coming from the [Buidler Runtime Environment] injecting its properties into it. 

In a traditional Ethereum project, you most likely have your tests written using Truffle, which also injects its main testing utilities into the global scope. By using the [buidler-truffle5](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/tree/master/packages/buidler-truffle5) plugin, you can get the same utilities in the global scope. Let's install it quickly:
```
$ npm install -D @nomiclabs/buidler-truffle5 @nomiclabs/buidler-web3
```
And add `usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-truffle5")` to the top of `buidler.config.js`, so that it looks like this:

```js
usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-truffle5");

task("accounts", "Prints a list of the available accounts", async () => {
  const accounts = await ethereum.send("eth_accounts");

  console.log("Accounts:", accounts);
});

module.exports = {};
```

Checkout the plugin's [README file](https://github.com/nomiclabs/buidler/tree/master/packages/buidler-truffle5) for more information about it.

Once you've installed the plugin, you will have access to `contract()` and `artifacts.require()` in the global scope, which you can use for a standard Truffle test. Let's add the following test to `test/sample-test.js`:

```js
const Greeter = artifacts.require("Greeter");

contract("Greeter", accounts => {
    it("should greet", async function() {
        const greeting = "Hello, Ethereum";
        const greeter = await Greeter.new(greeting);

        assert.equal(await greeter.greet(), greeting);
    });
});
```

```
$ npx buidler test
All contracts have already been compiled, skipping compilation.


  Ethereum provider
    ✓ Should return the accounts

  Greeter
    ✓ should greet (227ms)


  2 passing (236ms)
```

This setup should allow you to use your Truffle tests with Buidler, as long as they don't use the Migrations feature, which is currently under development.
