# Writing scripts with Buidler

In this guide we will go through the steps of creating a script with Buidler. For a general overview of using Buidler refer to theÂ [Getting started guide].

You can write your custom scripts that can use all of Buidler's functionality. A classic use case is writing a deployment script for your smart contracts. 

There are two ways of writing a script that accesses the [Buidler Runtime Environment].

## Buidler CLI dependant

You can write scripts that access the [Buidler Runtime Environment]'s properties
as global variables.

These scripts must be run through Buidler: `npx buidler run script.js`. 

This makes it easy to port scripts that were developed for other tools that inject variables into the global state. 

## Standalone scripts: using Buidler as a library

The second option leverages Buidler's architecture to allow for more flexibility. Buidler has been designed as a library, allowing you to get creative and build standalone CLI tools that access your development environment. This means that by simply requiring it:

```js
const bre = require("@nomiclabs/buidler");
```

You can get access to all your tasks and plugins. To run these scripts you simply go through node: `node script.js`.

To try this out, let's look at a fresh Buidler project. Run `npx buidler` and go through the steps to create a sample project. When you're done your project directory should look like this:

```
$ ls -l
total 400
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff     195 Jul 30 15:27 buidler.config.js
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Jul 30 15:27 contracts
drwxr-xr-x  502 fzeoli  staff   16064 Jul 30 15:31 node_modules
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff  194953 Jul 30 15:31 package-lock.json
-rw-r--r--    1 fzeoli  staff     365 Jul 30 15:31 package.json
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Jul 30 15:27 scripts
drwxr-xr-x    3 fzeoli  staff      96 Jul 30 15:27 test
```

Inside `scripts/` you will find `sample-script.js`. Read through its comments to have a better idea of what it does.

<<< @/../packages/buidler-core/sample-project/scripts/sample-script.js

Done? Before running the script with `node` you need to declare `ethers`. This is needed because Buidler won't be injecting it on the global scope as it does when calling the `run` task.

```js{2}
const bre = require("@nomiclabs/buidler");
const ethers = bre.ethers;

async function main() {
  //...
}
```

Now you're ready to run the script:

```
$ node scripts/sample-script.js
Greeter address: 0x7c2C195CD6D34B8F845992d380aADB2730bB9C6F
```

By accessing the [Buidler Runtime Environment] at the top, you are allowed to run the script in a standalone fashion. Buidler always runs the compile task when running scripts through it. But in a standalone fashion you may want to call compile manually to make sure everything is compiled. This is done by calling `bre.run('compile')`. Uncomment the following line out and re-run the script with `node`:

```js
await bre.run("compile");
```

```
$ node scripts/sample-script.js
All contracts have already been compiled, skipping compilation.
Greeter address: 0x7c2C195CD6D34B8F845992d380aADB2730bB9C6F
```

### Buidler arguments

You can still pass arguments to Buidler when using it as a library. This is done
by setting environment variables. These are: 

* `BUIDLER_NETWORK`: Sets the network to connect to.

* `BUIDLER_SHOW_STACK_TRACES`: Enables JavaScript stack traces of expected errors.

* `BUIDLER_VERBOSE`: Enables Buidler verbose logging.

* `BUIDLER_MAX_MEMORY`: Sets the maximum amount of memory that Buidler can use.
