# Testing with ethers.js & Waffle

[Waffle](https://getwaffle.io/) is a simple smart contract testing library built on top of [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/). Tests in Waffle are written using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) alongside with [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/). It's our recommended choice for testing.

Let's see how to use it going through Buidler's sample project.

::: tip
Waffle supports TypeScript. Learn how to set up Buidler with TypeScript [here](/typescript.md).

## Setting up

[Install Buidler](/getting-started/#local-installation-recommended) on an empty directory. When done, run `npx buidler`.  

```
$ npx buidler
888               d8b      888 888
888               Y8P      888 888

üë∑ Welcome to Buidler v1.0.0 üë∑‚Äç‚Äç

? What do you want to do? ‚Ä¶
‚ùØ Create a sample project
  Create an empty buidler.config.js
  Quit
```

Select `Create a sample project`. This will create some files but also install the necessary packages.

::: tip
Buidler will let you know how, but in case you missed it you can install them with `npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/buidler-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/buidler-ethers ethers`
:::

Look at the `buidler.config.js` file and you'll see that the Waffle plugin is enabled:

<<< @/../packages/buidler-core/sample-project/buidler.config.js{1}

::: tip 
There's no need for `usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-ethers")`, as `buidler-waffle` already does it.
:::

## Testing

Inside `test` folder you'll find  `sample-test.js`. Let's take a look at it, and we'll explain it next:

<<< @/../packages/buidler-core/sample-project/test/sample-test.js

On your terminal run `npx buidler test`. You should see the following output:

```
$ npx buidler test
Compiling...
Compiled 1 contract successfully


  Contract: Greeter
    ‚úì Should return the new greeting once it's changed (762ms)

  1 passing (762ms)
```

This means the test passed. Let's now explain each line:

```js
const { expect } = require("chai");
```
We are requiring `Chai` which is an assertions library. These asserting functions are called "matchers", and the ones we're using here actually come from Waffle. This is why we're using the `buidler-waffle` plugin, which makes it easier to assert values from Ethereum. Check out [this section](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/matchers.html) in Waffle's documentation for the entire list of Ethereum-specific matchers.

```js
describe("Greeter", function() {
  it("Should return the new greeting once it's changed", async function() {
    // ...
  });
});
```

This wrapper just follows Mocha's proposed structure for tests, but you might have noticed the use of `async` in `it`'s callback function. Interacting with the Ethereum network and smart contracts are asynchronous operations, hence most APIs and libraries use JavaScript's `Promise` for returning values. This use of `async` will allow us to `await` the calls to our contract and the Buidler EVM node.

```js
const Greeter = await ethers.getContractFactory("Greeter");
```

A `ContractFactory` in `ethers.js` is an abstraction used to deploy new smart contracts, so `Greeter` here is a factory for instances of our greeter contract.

```js
const greeter = await Greeter.deploy("Hello, world!");
```

Calling `deploy()` on a `ContractFactory` will start the deployment, and return a `Promise` that resolves to a `Contract`. This is the object that has a method for each of your smart contract functions. Here we're passing the string `Hello, world!` to the contract's constructor.

```js
await greeter.deployed();
```

When you call on `deploy()` the transaction is sent, but the contract isn't actually deployed until the transaction is mined. Calling `deployed()` will return a `Promise` that resolves once this happens, so this code is blocking until the deployment finishes.

Once the contract is deployed, we can call our contract methods on `greeter` and use them to get the state of the contract.

```js
expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hello, world!");
```

Here we're using our `Contract` instance to call a smart contract function in our Solidity code. `greet()` returns the greeter's greeting and we're checking that it's equal to `Hello, world!`, as it should. To do this we're using the Chai matchers `expect`, `to` and `equal`. 

```js
await greeter.setGreeting("Hola, mundo!");
expect(await greeter.greet()).to.equal("Hola, mundo!");
```

We can modify the state of a contract in the same way we read from it. Calling `setGreeting` will set a new greeting message. After the `Promise` is resolved, we perform another assertion to verify that the greeting effectively changed.

### Testing from a different account

If you need to send a transaction from an account other than the default one, you can use the `connect()` method provided by Ethers.js.

The first step to do so is to get the `Signers` object from `ethers`:
```js
const [owner, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();
```
A `Signer` in Ethers.js is an object that represents an Ethereum account. It's used to send transactions to contracts and other accounts. Here we're getting a list of the accounts in the node we're connected to, which in this case is **Buidler EVM**, and only keeping the first and second ones.

::: tip
To learn more about `Signer`, you can look at the [Signers documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/ethers.js/html/api-wallet.html).
:::

The `ethers` variable is available in the global scope. If you like your code always being explicit, you can add this line at the top:
```js
const { ethers } = require("@nomiclabs/buidler");
```

Finally, to execute a contract's method from another account, all you need to do is `connect` the `Contract` with the method being executed:

```js
await greeter.connect(addr1).setGreeting("Hallo, Erde!");
```

## Migrating an existing Waffle project

If you're starting a project from scratch and looking to use Waffle, you can skip this section. If you're setting up an existing Waffle project to use Buidler you'll need to migrate the [configuration options](https://ethereum-waffle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html) Waffle offers. The following table maps Waffle configurations to their Buidler equivalents:
|Waffle|Buidler|
|---|---|
|`sourcesPath`|`paths.sources`|
|`targetPath`|`paths.artifacts`|
|`solcVersion`|`solc.version` (version number only)|
|`compilerOptions.evmVersion`|`solc.evmVersion`|
|`compilerOptions.optimizer`|`solc.optimizer`|

As an example, this Waffle configuration file:

```json
{
  "sourcesPath": "./some_custom/contracts_path",
  "targetPath": "../some_custom/build",
  "solcVersion": "v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "evmVersion": "constantinople",
    "optimizer": {
      "enabled": true,
      "runs": 200
    }
  }
}
```

Would translate into this Buidler config:

```js
module.exports = {
  paths: {
    sources: "./some_custom/contracts_path",
    artifacts: "../some_custom/build"
  },
  solc: {
    version: "0.4.24", // Note that this only has the version number
    evmVersion: "constantinople",
    optimizer: {
      enabled: true,
      runs: 200
    }
  }
};
```

If you're migrating an existing Waffle project to Buidler, then the minimum configuration you'll need is changing Buidler's compilation output path, since Waffle uses a different one by default:

```js
usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");

module.exports = {
  paths: {
    artifacts: "./build"
  }
};
```

### Adapting the tests

Now, when testing using a standalone Waffle setup, this is how the provider is initialized for testing:

```js
// legacy Waffle API
const provider = createMockProvider();

// new Waffle API
const provider = new MockProvider();
```

This initialization is already handled by `@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle`. Just be sure to include `usePlugin("@nomiclabs/buidler-waffle");` in your Buidler config and use the plugin's provider like this

```js
const provider = waffle.provider;
```

Run your tests with `npx buidler test` and you should get stack traces when a transaction fails.
