# Hardhat Network

Hardhat comes built-in with Hardhat Network, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code.

## How does it work?

- It mines a block with each transaction that it receives, in order and with no delay.
- It's backed by the `@ethereumjs/vm` EVM implementation, the same one used by ganache, Remix and Ethereum Studio.
- It supports the following hardforks:
  - byzantium
  - constantinople
  - petersburg
  - istanbul
  - muirGlacier

## How can I use it?

- Hardhat will always spin up an instance on startup when `defaultNetwork` is empty or set to `hardhat`. It's the default behavior.
- It can be used to run tests in the console, and to run scripts and tasks.
- Plugins (ethers.js, web3.js, Waffle, Truffle, etc) connect directly to its provider.
- There's no need to make any changes to your tests or scripts.
- It's simply another network and it can be used with `--network`.

## Connecting to Hardhat Network from wallets and other software

Hardhat Network can run in a standalone fashion so that external clients can connect to it. This could be MetaMask, your Dapp front-end, or a script. To run Hardhat Network in this way, run:

```
npx hardhat node
```

It will start Hardhat Network, and expose it as a JSON-RPC and WebSocket server.

Then, just connect your wallet or application to `http://localhost:8545`.

If you want to connect Hardhat to this node, you only need to run Hardhat using `--network localhost`.

## Solidity stack traces

Hardhat Network has first-class Solidity support. It always knows which smart contracts are being run, what they do exactly and why they fail.

If a transaction or call fails, Hardhat Network will throw an exception. This exception will have a combined JavaScript and Solidity stack trace: stack traces that start in JavaScript/TypeScript up to your call to the contract, and continue with the full Solidity call stack.

This is an example of a Hardhat Network exception using `TruffleContract`:

```
Error: Transaction reverted: function selector was not recognized and there's no fallback function
  at ERC721Mock.<unrecognized-selector> (contracts/mocks/ERC721Mock.sol:9)
  at ERC721Mock._checkOnERC721Received (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:334)
  at ERC721Mock._safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:196)
  at ERC721Mock.safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:179)
  at ERC721Mock.safeTransferFrom (contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol:162)
  at TruffleContract.safeTransferFrom (node_modules/@nomiclabs/truffle-contract/lib/execute.js:157:24)
  at Context.<anonymous> (test/token/ERC721/ERC721.behavior.js:321:26)
```

The last two lines correspond to the JavaScript test code that executed a failing transaction. The rest is the Solidity stack trace. This way you know exactly why your tests aren't passing.

## Automatic error messages

Hardhat Network always knows why your transaction or call failed, and uses this information to make debugging your contracts easier.

When a transaction fails without a reason, Hardhat Network will create a clear error message in the following cases:

- Calling a non-payable function with ETH

- Sending ETH to a contract without a payable fallback or receive function

- Calling a non-existent function when there's no fallback function

- Calling a function with incorrect parameters

- Calling an external function that doesn't return the right amount of data

- Calling an external function on a non-contract account

- Failing to execute an external call because of its parameters (e.g. trying to send too much ETH)

- Calling a library without `DELEGATECALL`

- Incorrectly calling a precompiled contract

- Trying to deploy a contract that exceeds the bytecode size limit imposed by [EIP-170](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-170)

## `console.log`

Hardhat Network allows you to print logging messages and contract variables by calling `console.log()` from your Solidity code. You can see an example in the Sample Project. Follow the steps in [Quick Start](/getting-started/README.md#quick-start) to try it out.

- You can use it in calls and transactions. It works with `view` functions, but not in `pure` ones.
- It always works, regardless of the call or transaction failing or being successful.
- To use it you need to import `hardhat/console.sol`.
- You can call `console.log` with up to 4 parameters in any order of following types:
  - `uint`
  - `string`
  - `bool`
  - `address`
- There's also the single parameter API for the types above, and additionally `bytes`, `bytes1`... up to `bytes32`:
  - `console.logInt(int i)`
  - `console.logUint(uint i)`
  - `console.logString(string memory s)`
  - `console.logBool(bool b)`
  - `console.logAddress(address a)`
  - `console.logBytes(bytes memory b)`
  - `console.logBytes1(bytes1 b)`
  - `console.logBytes2(bytes2 b)`
  - ...
  - `console.logBytes32(bytes32 b)`
- `console.log` implements the same formatting options that can be found in Node.js' [`console.log`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/console.html#console_console_log_data_args), which in turn uses [`util.format`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/docs/api/util.html#util_util_format_format_args).
  - Example: `console.log("Changing owner from %s to %s", currentOwner, newOwner)`
- It works with any library: ethers.js, web3.js, waffle, truffle-contract, etc.
- `console.log` is implemented in standard Solidity and then detected in Hardhat Network. This makes its compilation work with any other tools (like Remix, Waffle or Truffle).
- `console.log` calls can run in other networks, like mainnet, kovan, ropsten, etc. They do nothing in those networks, but do spend a minimal amount of gas.

## Mainnet forking

The Hardhat Network is empty by default, except for some accounts with an initial balance. But sometimes it's more useful to have a local network that simulates the state of the mainnet. This is what forking is for.

To fork from the mainnet you need the URL of a node to connect to. For example, using Alchemy, you can start a local node that forks the mainnet with this command:

```
npx hardhat node --fork https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>
```

where you have to replace `<key>` with your Alchemy API key.

After doing this, you can do anything in your node that you can do with a non-forked Hardhat Network: see console logs, get stack traces or use the default accounts to deploy new contracts.

If you want this to be the default behavior, you can do it in your Hardhat config:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    forking: {
      url: "https://eth-mainnet.alchemyapi.io/v2/<key>";
    }
  }
}
```

This means that if you execute a task that uses the Hardhat Network, that task will start a forked node and run on it.

There are other things you can do with a forked Hardhat Network, check [our guide](../guides/mainnet-forking.md) to learn more.

## Mining modes

Hardhat supports two modes for mining transactions:

- **Automine**: each transaction that is sent is automatically included in a new block
- **Interval mining**: a new block is periodically mined, which includes as many pending transactions as possible

You can use one of these modes, both or neither. By default, only the automine mode is enabled.

### Configuring mining modes

You can configure the mining behavior under your Hardhat Network settings:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: 5000
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, automining is disabled and interval mining is set so that a new block is generated every 5 seconds. You can also configure interval mining to generate a new block after a random delay:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: [3000, 6000]
    }
  }
}
```

In this case, a new block will be mined after a random delay of between 3 and 6 seconds. For example, the first block could be mined after 4 seconds, the second block 5.5 seconds after that, and so on.

### Manual mining

You can disable both mining modes like this:

```js
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    mining: {
      auto: false,
      interval: 0
    }
  }
}
```

This means that no new blocks will be mined by the Hardhat Network, but you can manually mine new blocks using the `evm_mine` RPC method. This will generate a new block that will include as many pending transactions as possible.

### Mempool behavior

When automine is disabled, every sent transaction is added to the mempool, which contains all the transactions that could be mined in the future. Hardhat Network's mempool follows the same rules as geth. This means, among other things, that:

- Transactions with a higher gas price are included first
- If two transactions can be included and both have the same gas price, the one that was received first is included first
- If a transaction is invalid (for example, its nonce is lower than the nonce of the address that sent it), the transaction is dropped.

You can get the list of pending transactions that will be included in the next block by using the "pending" block tag:

```js
const pendingBlock = await network.provider.send("eth_getBlockByNumber", [
  "pending",
  false,
]);
```

### Removing and replacing transactions

Transactions in the mempool can be removed using the `hardhat_dropTransaction` method:

```js
const txHash = "0xabc...";
await network.provider.send("hardhat_dropTransaction", [txHash]);
```

You can also replace a transaction by sending a new one with the same nonce as the one that it's already in the mempool but with a higher gas price. Keep in mind that, like in Geth, for this to work the new gas price has to be at least 10% higher than the gas price of the current transaction.

### Configuring mining modes using RPC methods

You can change the mining behavior on runtime using two RPC methods: `evm_setAutomine` and `evm_setIntervalMining`. For example, to disable automining:

```js
await network.provider.send("evm_setAutomine", [false]);
```

And to enable interval mining:

```js
await network.provider.send("evm_setIntervalMining", [5000]);
```

## Logging

Hardhat Network uses its tracing infrastructure to offer rich logging that will help you develop and debug smart contracts.

For example, a successful transaction and a failed call would look like this:

```
eth_sendTransaction
  Contract deployment: Greeter
  Contract address: 0x8858eeb3dfffa017d4bce9801d340d36cf895ccf
  Transaction: 0x7ea2754e53f09508d42bd3074046f90595bedd61fcdf75a4764453454733add0
  From: 0xc783df8a850f42e7f7e57013759c285caa701eb6
  Value: 0 ETH
  Gas used: 568851 of 2844255
  Block: #2 - Hash: 0x4847b316b12170c576999183da927c2f2056aa7d8f49f6e87430e6654a56dab0

  console.log:
    Deploying a Greeter with greeting: Hello, world!

eth_call
  Contract call: Greeter#greet
  From: 0xc783df8a850f42e7f7e57013759c285caa701eb6

  Error: VM Exception while processing transaction: revert Not feeling like it
      at Greeter.greet (contracts/Greeter.sol:14)
      at process._tickCallback (internal/process/next_tick.js:68:7)
```

This logging is enabled by default when using Hardhat Network's node (i.e. `npx hardhat node`), but disabled when using the in-process Hardhat Network provider. See [Hardhat Network's config](../config/README.md#hardhat-network) to learn more about how to control its logging.

## The `debug_traceTransaction` method

You can get debug traces of already mined transactions using the `debug_traceTransaction` RPC method. The returned object has a detailed description of the transaction execution, including a list of steps describing each executed opcode and the state of the EVM at that point.

To get a trace, call this method with the hash of the transaction as its argument:

```js
const trace = await hre.network.provider.send("debug_traceTransaction", [
  "0x123...",
]);
```

You can also selectively disable some properties in the list of steps:

```js
const trace = await hre.network.provider.send("debug_traceTransaction", [
  "0x123...",
  {
    disableMemory: true,
    disableStack: true,
    disableStorage: true,
  },
]);
```

If you are using [mainnet forking](https://hardhat.org/guides/mainnet-forking.html) with an archive node, you can get traces of transactions from the remote network even if the node you are using doesn't support `debug_traceTransaction`.

### Known limitations

- You can't trace transactions that use a hardfork older than [Spurious Dragon](https://ethereum.org/en/history/#spurious-dragon)
- The last step of a message is not guaranteed to have a correct value in the `gasCost` property

## Hardhat Network initial state

Hardhat Network is initialized by default in this state:

- A brand new blockchain, just with the genesis block.
- 20 accounts with 10000 ETH each, generated with the mnemonic `"test test test test test test test test test test test junk"`. Their addresses are:

#### Hardhat network methods

- `hardhat_addCompilationResult` – Add information about compiled contracts
- `hardhat_dropTransaction` – Remove a transaction from the mempool
- `hardhat_impersonateAccount` – see the [Mainnet Forking guide](../guides/mainnet-forking.md)
- `hardhat_reset` – see the [Mainnet Forking guide](../guides/mainnet-forking.md)
- `hardhat_setBalance` – Modifies the balance of an account.
- `hardhat_setCode` – Modifies the code of an account.
- `hardhat_setLoggingEnabled` – Enable or disable logging in Hardhat Network
- `hardhat_setMinGasPrice` - change the minimum gas price accepted by the network (in wei)
- `hardhat_setNonce` – Modifies an account's nonce by overwriting it. Throws an InvalidInputError if nonce is smaller than the current one. The reason for this restriction is to avoid collisions when deploying contracts using the same nonce more than once.
- `hardhat_setStorageAt` – Writes a single position of an account's storage. The storage position index must not exceed 2^256, and the value to write must be exactly 32 bytes long.
- `hardhat_stopImpersonatingAccount` – see the [Mainnet Forking guide](../guides/mainnet-forking.md)

#### Special testing/debugging methods

- `evm_increaseTime` – same as Ganache.
- `evm_mine` – same as Ganache
- `evm_revert` – same as Ganache.
- `evm_snapshot` – same as Ganache.
- `evm_setNextBlockTimestamp` - this method works like `evm_increaseTime`, but takes the exact timestamp that you want in the next block, and increases the time accordingly.

## Limitations

### Supported Solidity versions

Hardhat Network can run any smart contract, but it only understands Solidity 0.5.1 and newer.

If you are compiling with an older version of Solidity, or using another language, you can use Hardhat Network, but Solidity stack traces won't be generated.

### Solidity optimizer support

Hardhat Network can work with smart contracts compiled with optimizations, but this may lead to your stack traces' line numbers being a little off.

We recommend compiling without optimizations when testing and debugging your contracts.
