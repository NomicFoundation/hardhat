# 3. Creating a new Hardhat project

We'll install Hardhat using the Node.js package manager (`npm`), which is both a package manager and an online repository for JavaScript code.

You can use other package managers with Node.js, but we suggest you use npm 7 or higher to follow this guide. You should already have it if you followed the previous section's steps.

Open a new terminal and run these commands to create a new folder:

```
mkdir hardhat-tutorial
cd hardhat-tutorial
```

Then initialize an npm project as shown below. You'll be prompted to answer some questions.

::::tip

Use the tabs in the snippets to select your preferred package manager. We recommend using npm 7 or later, since it makes installing Hardhat's dependencies much easier.

::::

::::tabsgroup{options="npm 7+,npm 6,yarn"}

:::tab{value="npm 7+"}

```
npm init
```

:::

:::tab{value="npm 6"}

```
npm init
```

:::

:::tab{value=yarn}

```
yarn init
```

:::

::::

Now we can install Hardhat:

::::tabsgroup{options="npm 7+,npm 6,yarn"}

:::tab{value="npm 7+"}

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

:::

:::tab{value="npm 6"}

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

:::

:::tab{value=yarn}

```
yarn add --dev hardhat
```

:::

::::

In the same directory where you installed Hardhat run:

```
npx hardhat
```

Select `Create an empty hardhat.config.js` with your keyboard and hit enter.

```markup{16}
$ npx hardhat

When Hardhat is run, it searches for the closest `hardhat.config.js` file starting from the current working directory. This file normally lives in the root of your project and an empty `hardhat.config.js` is enough for Hardhat to work. The entirety of your setup is contained in this file.

## Hardhat's architecture

Hardhat is designed around the concepts of tasks and plugins. The bulk of Hardhat's functionality comes from plugins, and [you're free to choose](/hardhat-runner/plugins/) the ones you want to use.

### Tasks

Every time you're running Hardhat from the command-line, you're running a task. For example, `npx hardhat compile` is running the `compile` task. To see the currently available tasks in your project, run `npx hardhat`. Feel free to explore any task by running `npx hardhat help [task]`.

:::tip

You can create your own tasks. Check out the [Creating a task](/guides/create-task.md) guide.

### Plugins

Hardhat is unopinionated in terms of what tools you end up using, but it does come with some built-in defaults. All of which can be overridden. Most of the time the way to use a given tool is by consuming a plugin that integrates it into Hardhat.

In this tutorial we are going to use our recommended plugin, [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox`](../hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-toolbox), which has everything you need for developing smart contracts.

To install it, run this in your project directory:

::::tabsgroup{options="npm 7+,npm 6,yarn"}

:::tab{value="npm 7+"}

```
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

:::

:::tab{value="npm 6"}

```
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers
```

:::

:::tab{value=yarn}

```
yarn add --dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox @nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers @nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan chai ethers hardhat-gas-reporter solidity-coverage @typechain/hardhat typechain @typechain/ethers-v5 @ethersproject/abi @ethersproject/providers
```

:::

::::

Add the highlighted line to your `hardhat.config.js` so that it looks like this:

```js{1}
require("@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox");

/** @type import('hardhat/config').HardhatUserConfig */
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.18",
};
```
