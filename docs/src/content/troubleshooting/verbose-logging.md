# Verbose logging

You can enable Hardhat's verbose mode by running it with its `--verbose` flag, or by setting the `HARDHAT_VERBOSE` environment variable to `true`.

This mode will print a lot of output that can be super useful for debugging. An example of a Hardhat run in verbose mode is:

```
$ npx hardhat test --verbose

Hardhat uses the [debug](https://github.com/visionmedia/debug) package to manage logging. The `DEBUG` environment variable can be used to turn on the verbose logging and filter it using a simple wildcard pattern.
