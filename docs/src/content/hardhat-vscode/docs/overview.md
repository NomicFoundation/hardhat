# Hardhat for Visual Studio Code

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) is a Visual Studio Code extension that adds language support for [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) to Visual Studio Code, and provides editor integration for [Hardhat projects](https://hardhat.org/). Integrations for other tools are coming in the near future.

Hardhat for Visual Studio code adds the following features:

- [Code completion](features.md#code-completions)
- [Go to definition, type definition and references](features.md#navigation)
- [Symbol renames](features.md#renames)
- [Solidity code formatting](features.md#format-document)
- [Inline code validation from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects](<features.md#inline-code-validation-(diagnostics)>)
- [Hover help for variables, function calls, errors, events etc.](features.md#hover)
- [Code actions (quickfixes) suggested from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects](features.md#code-actions)

## Installation

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) can be installed by using the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

Some features (e.g. inline validation, quick fixes) are still experimental and are only enabled within a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project, this is a limitation that will be lifted with future releases.

## Setup

This extension should work without any configuration. If formatting functionality isn't working, or you have previously configured another **Solidity** formatter, please see the [formatting section](#formatting).

## Hardhat Projects

Hardhat for Visual Studio Code provides enhanced functionality for Solidity files within a Hardhat project, including inline validation and quick fixes.

To take advantage of these features, use the `File` menu to `Open Folder`, and select the folder containing the `hardhat.config.{js,ts}` file.

Inline validation (the display of compiler errors and warnings against the code) is based on your Hardhat configuration file. The version of the `solc` solidity compiler used for validation is set within this file, see the [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/config/#solidity-configuration) for more details.

### Monorepo Support

Hardhat for Visual Studio Code will detect Hardhat projects (folders containing a `hardhat.config.{js,ts}` file) within a monorepo, when the root of the monorepo is opened as a workspace folder.

The Hardhat config file that is used when validating a Solidity file is shown in the Solidity section on the _Status Bar_:

## Formatting

Hardhat for Visual Studio Code provides formatting support for `.sol` files, by leveraging [prettier-plugin-solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity).

> **Note:** if you currently have other solidity extensions installed, or have had previously, they may be set as your default formatter for solidity files.

To set Hardhat for Visual Studio Code as your default formatter for solidity files:

1. Within a Solidity file run the _Format Document With_ command, either through the Command Palette, or by right clicking and selecting through the context menu:

![Format Document With](/hardhat-vscode-images/format_document_with.png "Format Document With")

2. Select `Configure Default Formatter...`

3. Select `Hardhat + Solidity` as the default formatter for solidity files

### Formatting Configuration

The default formatting rules that will be applied are taken from [prettier-plugin-solidity](https://github.com/prettier-solidity/prettier-plugin-solidity#configuration-file), with the exception that `explicitTypes` are preserved (rather than forced).

To override the settings, add a `prettierrc` configuration file at the root of your project. Add a `*.sol` file override to the prettier configuration file and change from the defaults shown:

```javascript
// .prettierrc.json
{
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": "*.sol",
      "options": {
        "printWidth": 80,
        "tabWidth": 4,
        "useTabs": false,
        "singleQuote": false,
        "bracketSpacing": false,
        "explicitTypes": "preserve"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
