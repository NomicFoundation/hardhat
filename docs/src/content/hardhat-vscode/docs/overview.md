# Hardhat for Visual Studio Code

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) is a VS Code extension that adds language support for [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) and provides editor integration for [Hardhat projects](https://hardhat.org/). Integrations for other tools are coming in the near future.

Hardhat for Visual Studio code adds the following features:

- [Code completion](#code-completions)
- [Go to definition, type definition and references](#navigation)
- [Symbol renames](#renames)
- [Solidity code formatting](#format-document)
- [Inline code validation from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects](<#inline-code-validation-(diagnostics)>)
- [Hover help for variables, function calls, errors, events etc.](#hover)
- [Code actions (quickfixes) suggested from compiler errors/warnings for Hardhat projects](#code-actions)

## Installation

[Hardhat for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) can be installed by using the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.

Some features (e.g. inline validation, quick fixes) are still experimental and are only enabled within a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project, this is a limitation that will be lifted with future releases.

This extension should work without any configuration. To learn more about how it works with Hardhat projects, please read [this section](./hardhat-projects.md). If formatting functionality isn't working, or you have previously configured another Solidity formatter, please see the [formatting section](./formatting.md).

## Features

### Code Completions

Hardhat for Visual Studio Code autocompletes references to existing symbols (e.g. contract instances, globally available variables and built-in types like arrays) and import directives (i.e. it autocompletes the path to the imported file).

Direct imports (those not starting with `./` or `../`) are completed based on suggestions from `./node_modules`.

Relative imports pull their suggestions from the file system based on the current solidity file's location.

### Navigation

Move through your codebase with semantic navigation commands:

#### Go to Definition

Navigates to the definition of an identifier.

#### Go to Type Definition

Navigates to the type of an identifier.

#### Go to References

Shows all references of the identifier under the cursor.

![Navigation](/hardhat-vscode-images/navigation.gif "Navigation")

### Renames

Rename the identifier under the cursor and all of its references:

![Rename](/hardhat-vscode-images/rename.gif "Rename")

### Format document

Apply solidity formatting to the current document.

The formatting configuration can be overriden through a `.prettierrc` file, see [Formatting Configuration](./formatting.md#formatting-configuration).

### Hover

Hovering the cursor over variables, function calls, errors and events will display a popup showing type and signature information:

### Inline code validation (Diagnostics)

As code is edited, Hardhat for Visual Studio Code runs the [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html) compiler over the changes and displays any warnings or errors it finds.

This feature is only available in solidity files that are part of a **Hardhat** project, as **Hardhat** is used for import resolution, see [Hardhat Projects](#hardhat-projects) for details.

### Code Actions

Code actions, or quickfixes are refactorings suggested to resolve a [solc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html) warning or error.

A line with a warning/error that has a _code action_, will appear with small light bulb against it; clicking the light bulb will provide the option to trigger the _code action_.

#### Implement missing functions on interface

A contract that implements an interface, but is missing functions specified in the interface, will get a `solidity(3656)` error.

The matching code action _Add missing functions from interface_ will determine which functions need to be implemented to satisfy the interface and add them as stubs to the body of the contract.

#### Constrain mutability

A function without a mutability keyword but which does not update contract state will show a `solidity(2018)` warning, with `solc` suggesting adding either the `view` or `pure` keyword depending on whether the function reads from state.

The matching code action _Add view/pure modifier to function declaration_ resolves the warning by adding the keyword to the function signature.

#### Adding `virtual`/`override` on inherited function signature

A function in an inheriting contract, that has the same name and parameters as a function in the base contract, causes `solidity(4334)` in the base contract function if it does not have the `virtual` keyword and `solidity(9456)` in the inheriting contract function if does not have the `override` keyword.

The _Add virtual specifier to function definition_ and _Add override specifier to function definition_ code actions appear against functions with these errors.

![Virtual and Override](/hardhat-vscode-images/virtual-override.gif "Virtual and Override")

#### Adding `public`/`private` to function signature

A function without an accessibility keyword will cause the `solidity(4937)` error.

Two code actions will appear against a function with this error: _Add public visibility to declaration_ and _Add private visibility to declaration_.
