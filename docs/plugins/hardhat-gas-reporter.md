# hardhat-gas-reporter

[eth-gas-reporter](https://github.com/cgewecke/eth-gas-reporter) plugin for [hardhat](http://gethardhat.com).

## What

**A Mocha reporter for Ethereum test suites:**

- Gas usage per unit test.
- Metrics for method calls and deployments.
- National currency costs of deploying and using your contract system.
- CI integration with [codechecks<sup>beta</sup>](http://codechecks.io)

### Example report

## Installation

```bash
npm install hardhat-gas-reporter --save-dev
```

And add the following to your `hardhat.config.js`:
```js
require("hardhat-gas-reporter");
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, add this to your hardhat.config.ts:
```ts
import "hardhat-gas-reporter"
```

**Looking for buidler-gas-reporter docs?** [They moved here...][1]

## Configuration
Configuration is optional.
```js
module.exports = {
  gasReporter: {
    currency: 'CHF',
    gasPrice: 21
  }
}
```
:bulb: **Pro Tips**

**Turning the plugin on/off**

The options include an `enabled` key that lets you toggle gas reporting on and off using shell
environment variables. When `enabled` is false, mocha's (faster) default spec reporter is used.
Example:

```js
module.exports = {
  gasReporter: {
    enabled: (process.env.REPORT_GAS) ? true : false
  }
}
```

**Migrating from Truffle**

If you already have `eth-gas-reporter` installed in your project, make sure you uninstall it before adding this plugin. 
`hardhat-gas-reporter` manages `eth-gas-reporter` as a dependency and having multiple versions in your lockfile can stop the reporter
from working correctly.

## Usage

This plugin overrides the built-in `test` task. Gas reports are generated by default with:
```
npx hardhat test
```

## Continuous Integration

This reporter comes with a [codechecks](http://codechecks.io) CI integration that
displays a pull request's gas consumption changes relative to its target branch in the Github UI.
It's like coveralls for gas. The codechecks service is free for open source and maintained by MakerDao engineer [@krzkaczor](https://github.com/krzkaczor).

## Options

:warning: **CoinMarketCap API change** :warning:

Beginning March 2020, CoinMarketCap requires an API key to access currency market
price data. The reporter uses an unprotected free tier key by default (10k reqs/mo). You can get
your own API key [here][55] and set it with the `coinmarketcap` option.
