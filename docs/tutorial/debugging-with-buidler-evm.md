# 6. Debugging with Buidler EVM
**Buidler** comes built-in with **Buidler EVM**, a local Ethereum network designed for development. It allows you to deploy your contracts, run your tests and debug your code. It's the default network **Buidler** connects to, so you don't need to setup anything for it to work. Just run your tests.

## Solidity `console.log`
When running your contracts and tests on **Buidler EVM** you can print logging messages and contract variables calling `console.log()` from your Solidity code. To use it you have to import **Buidler**'s`console.log` from your contract code.

This is what it looks like:

```solidity{3}
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;

import "@nomiclabs/buidler/console.sol";

contract Token {
  //...
}
```

Add some `console.log` to the `transfer()` function as if you were using it in JavaScript:

```solidity{2,3}
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    console.log("Sender balance is %s tokens", balances[msg.sender]);
    console.log("Trying to send %s tokens to %s", amount, to);

    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Not enough tokens");

    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    balances[to] += amount;
}
```

The logging output will show when you run your tests:

```{11-14,17-20}
$ npx buidler test
