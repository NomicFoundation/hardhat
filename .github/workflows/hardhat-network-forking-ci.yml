  # We should run this tests with multiple configurations
  # but somehow the requests to Alchemy take much longer when doing that.
  # As a temporary workaround, we run them with a single config.
  #
  # Once we properly refactor Hardhat Network's tests we should
  # add more configurations (different OS and node versions).
  #
  # We should also understand what's going on before blindly refactoring them.
