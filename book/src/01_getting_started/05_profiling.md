# Profiling

```bash
pnpm build:tracing
```

When you now run `edr`, it will generate a `tracing.folded` file in the current working directory.
Once the profiling run has completed, we can use [`inferno`](https://docs.rs/tracing-flame/latest/tracing_flame/#generating-the-image) to generate flamegraphs from the collected data.
To install `inferno`, run:

```bash
cargo install inferno
```

When we want to analyze the run with its exact order preserved, run:

```bash
cat tracing.folded | inferno-flamegraph --flamechart > tracing-flamechart.svg
```


Alternatively, when we don't care about those details, a flamegraph with identical stack frames collapsed can be generated by running:

```bash
cat tracing.folded | inferno-flamegraph > tracing-flamegraph.svg
```
