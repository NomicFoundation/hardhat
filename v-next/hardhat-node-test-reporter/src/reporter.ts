     * The test reporter works by keeping a stack of the currently executing[1]
     * tests and suites. We use it to keep track of the context of a test, so that
     * when it passes or fails, we can print that context (if necessary), before
     * its results.
     *
     * Printing the context of a test will normally imply printing all the
     * describes where it is nested.
     *
     * As the context may be shared by more than one test, and we don't want to
     * repeat it, we keep track of the last printed context element. We do this
     * by keeping track of its index in the stack.
     *
     * We also keep track of any diagnostic message that is reported by node:test
     * and at the end we try to parse the global diagnostics to gather information
     * about the test run. If during this parsing we don't recognize or can't
     * properly parse one of this diagnostics, we will print it at the end.
     *
     * Whenever a test fails, we pre-format its failure reason, so that we don't
     * need to keep the failure event in memory, and we can still print the
     * failure reason at the end.
     *
     * This code is structured in the following way:
     *  - We use an async generator to process the events as they come, printing
     *  the information as soon as possible.
     *  - Instead of printing, we yield string.
     *  - Any formatting that needs to be done is done in the formatting module.
     *  - The formatting module exports functions that generate strings for the
     *  different parts of the test run's output. They do not print anything, and
     *  they never end in a newline. Any newline between different parts of the
     *  output is added by the generator.
     *  - The generator drives the high-level format of the output, and only uses
     *  the formatting functions to generate repetitive parts of it.
     *
     * [1] As reported by node:test, in definition order, which may differ from
     * actual execution order.
