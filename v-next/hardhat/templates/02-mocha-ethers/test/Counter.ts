/*
 * In Hardhat 3, there isn't a single global connection to a network. Instead,
 * you have a `network` object that allows you to connect to different
 * networks.
 *
 * You can create multiple network connections using `network.connect`.
 * It takes two optional parameters and returns a `NetworkConnection` object.
 *
 * Its parameters are:
 *
 * 1. The name of the network configuration to use (from `config.networks`).
 *
 * 2. The `ChainType` to use.
 *
 * Providing a `ChainType` ensures the connection is aware of the kind of
 * chain it's using, potentially affecting RPC interactions for HTTP
 * connections, and changing the simulation behavior for EDR networks.
 *
 * If you don't provide a `ChainType`, it will be inferred from the network
 * config, and default to `generic` if not specified in the config.
 *
 * Every time you call `network.connect` with an EDR network config name, a
 * new instance of EDR will be created. Each of these instances has its own
 * state and blockchain, and they have no communication with each other.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * - `await network.connect({network: "sepolia", chainType: "l1"})`: Connects
 *   to the `sepolia` network config, treating it as an "l1" network.
 *
 * - `await network.connect(network: "hardhatOp", chainType: "optimism"})`:
 *   Creates a new EDR instance in Optimism mode, using the `hardhatOp`
 *   network config.
 *
 * - `await network.connect()`: Creates a new EDR instance with the default
 *    network config (i.e. `hardhat`) and the `generic` chain type.
 *
 * Each network connection object has a `provider` property and other
 * network-related fields added by plugins, like `ethers` and `networkHelpers`.
