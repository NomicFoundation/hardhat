# A TypeScript Hardhat project using Mocha and Ethers

> WARNING: This demonstration project is still in development. It is part of the Hardhat v3 upgrade. It is not for production use.

This project demonstrates basic Hardhat usecases within a TypeScript project. It comes with a minimal Hardhat configuration file and a test.

For integration testing it uses the Mocha test runner and the Ethers.js library for interacting with Ethereum nodes.

Try running the following commands to see Hardhat in action:

```shell
# Run the mocha integration test suite
npx hardhat3 test
```
