     * This hook is triggered when test files are passed to the test plugin, but no test runner is specified. It runs before the tests are executed.

     * When this hook is invoked, the plugin receives the file path and it should check whether it matches the configured test path.
     * If it does, the plugin should return its test runner; otherwise, it should call the next function to allow other plugins to process the file.
     *
     * @param context The hook context.
     * @param filePath The path to the test file.
     * @param next A function to call the next handler for this hook, or the
     * default implementation if no more handlers exist.
