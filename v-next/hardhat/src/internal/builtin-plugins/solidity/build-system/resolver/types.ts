 *  - Loading an npm package requires processing its remappigns.

/**
 * A Resolver is a stateful object that can be used to to construct a dependency
 * graph, by resolving both the local project and npm files, and their imports.
 *
 * This resolver uses `inputSourceName`s to identify the resolved files, which
 * are  not necessarily related to the file path.
 *
 * The `inputSourceName` of a Hardhat project file is its relative path from the
 * project root, prefixed by `project/`. For example, if the project root is
 * `/home/user/foo`, and there are files `/home/user/foo/contracts/File.sol` and
 * `home/user/foo/File2.sol`, their input source names are
 * `project/contracts/File.sol` and `project/File2.sol`.
 *
 * The `inputSourceName` of an npm file is
 * `npm/<package-name>@<version>/<path>`. This is constructed by using the
 * Node.js resolution algorithm, to resolve an npm file or import, and using the
 * package's `package.json` file to determine the input source name. For
 * example, if we import `foo/bar.sol`, its input source name could be
 * `npm/foo@1.2.3/bar.sol`.
 *
 * If the Node.js resolution algorithm resolve a file into a package that's
 * part of the monorepo where the Hardhat project is (i.e. it's not part of a
 * `node_modules` directory), the user source name is going to be
 * `npm/package@local/path/to/file`.
 *
 * Note that in the Node.js ecosystem, a package manager may install multiple
 * instances of the same package and version (i.e. fail to deduplicate them).
 * In those cases the Resolver will use the first instance it finds, and will
 * always resolve to that one.
