// Things to note:
//  - This resolver assumes that the root of the project is the folder with the
//    closest package.json to the config file.
//  - Each file system file is resolved to a single ResolvedFile, with a unique
//    source name.
//  - Files within the project have their relative path as their source name.
//  - Files within npm packages have source names that start with `npm/` and
//    contain the package name and version. e.g. `npm/package@1.2.3/path.sol`.
//  - Files within npm packages that are part of a monorepo are resolved like
//    npm pacakges, but with the version `local`.
//  - This resolver does not support `package.json#exports`.
//  - This resolver fails if an import has a casing different from that of the
//    file system.
//  - We do not allow users to remap the imports present in files within npm
//    packages, by forbidding user remappings with context and starting with
//    `npm/`.
//  - We do allow users to remap imports of non-npm files, including remmapping
//    them into file within npm packages.
//  - Every import in an npm file is either relative or remapped by a remapping
//    generated by the resolver.
//  - A direct import (i.e. not relative) is considered to be local within the
//    the project/package if it is a bare file name (not in a directory), or if
//    the first directory exists in the project/package.
//  - The direct import "hardhat/console.sol" is a special case and it is never
//    considered to be local. And we only remap `hardhat/console.sol`.
//  - Local imports within the project may be remapped by user remappings, but
//    not by the resolver.
//  - Imports into npm packages are always remapped, if not by the user, by the
//    resolver.
//  - Direct local improts within npm package are always remapped by the
//    resolver.
