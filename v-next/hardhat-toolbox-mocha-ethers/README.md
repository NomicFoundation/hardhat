# hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers

This toolbox includes a set of plugins to build Hardhat projects with [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) as the connection library and [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) for TypeScript tests. If you are migrating a Hardhat 2 project that uses that stack, this toolbox is the recommended way to upgrade.

## Sample project

You can initialize a project based on this toolbox by running `npx hardhat --init` and selecting `A TypeScript Hardhat project using Mocha and Ethers.js` as the project type.

## Manual installation

If you want to add the toolbox manually, first install the package:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers
```

Then add it to your Hardhat configuration:

```typescript
import hardhatToolboxMochaEthers from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers";

export default {
  plugins: [hardhatToolboxMochaEthers],
};
```

## Included functionality

With this toolbox, you can:

- Use [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/) as the connection library for interacting with the network
- Write Solidity tests using Hardhat's built-in test runner
- Write TypeScript tests using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and our [chai matchers plugin](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers).
- Verify contracts with [hardhat-verify](https://hardhat.org/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify)
- Deploy contracts using [Hardhat Ignition](https://hardhat.org/ignition)

## Bundled plugins

When you install `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox-mocha-ethers`, these plugins are automatically installed as peer dependencies:

- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-ethers)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-ignition)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ignition-ethers`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-ignition-ethers)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-keystore`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-keystore)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-mocha`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-mocha)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-network-helpers)
- [`@nomicfoundation/hardhat-typechain`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/hardhat-typechain)

- [`@nomicfoundation/ignition-core`](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat/tree/v-next/v-next/ignition-core)

## Explicitly installing plugins

In some cases, you may need to manually install one of the included plugins. This can happen if:

- You want to use a different version than the one included in the toolbox.
- You need to import something from the plugin in your code and need to have it in your `package.json` to avoid issues.

For example, the `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers` plugin includes an `anyValue` predicate that can be used along with the `.withArgs` matcher. If you want to use this predicate in your code, you need to install the plugin explicitly:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers
```

Then you'll be able to import things from the plugin:

```typescript
import { anyValue } from "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers-chai-matchers/withArgs";
```
