/**
 * A merge group can contain multiple PRs at once - to proceed the merge group should be either:
 * 1. Only a release PR (+ no changeset changes PRs)
 * 2. A collection of standard feature PRs (+ no changeset changes PRs)
 *
 * If the merge group has no changesets but there are unreleased packages (version locally is higher than NPM), we know we have only a Release PR.
 * If the there are changesets, but all versions locally match NPM, then we have a collection of standard feature PRs - and no Release PR.
 * We are only invalid if we have both changesets and unreleased packages. This indicates a Release PR is being unintentionally mixed with a new Feature PR - we throw on this case.
