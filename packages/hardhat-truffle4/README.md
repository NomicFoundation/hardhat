# hardhat-truffle4

[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) plugin for integration with TruffleContract from Truffle 4

## What

This plugin brings to Hardhat TruffleContracts from Truffle 4. With it you can call [`contract()` and `artifacts.require()`](https://truffleframework.com/docs/truffle/testing/writing-tests-in-javascript) like you normally would with Truffle. Interact with your contracts with a familiar API from tasks, scripts and tests.

Additionally, you can **migrate your contracts to Solidity 5 without needing to migrate your tests to Truffle 5**.

## Required plugins

This plugin requires [hardhat-web3-legacy](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/tree/master/packages/hardhat-web3-legacy) as a prerequisite.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev @nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle4 @nomiclabs/hardhat-web3-legacy web3@^0.20.7
```

And add the following statement to your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle4");
```

Or, if you are using TypeScript, add this to your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```js
import "@nomiclabs/hardhat-truffle4";
```

## Tasks

This plugin creates no additional tasks.

## Environment extensions

An instance of [`TruffleEnvironmentArtifacts`](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/blob/master/packages/hardhat-truffle4/src/artifacts.ts) is injected into `env.artifacts` and the method `contract()` is injected into the global scope for using in tests.

## Usage

There are no additional steps you need to take for this plugin to work.

Install it, run `npx hardhat test` and your Truffle tests should run with no need to make any modifications.
