# hardhat

## 2.9.1

### Patch Changes

- 69a6434e: Fix a bug that made Hardhat Network hang when connecting MetaMask (#2380)

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- bf017963: Add a new RPC method, `hardhat_mine`, which supports the mining of multiple blocks in a single call (#1112)
- 345ebab7: The `test` task now supports a `--parallel` flag to run tests in parallel. There are also two other new flags: `--bail`, to stop the execution after the first test failure, and `--grep`, to filter which tests should be run.

  To support running tests in parallel, the version of `mocha` used by Hardhat was upgraded to its latest version. This should be a mostly backward-compatible change, but there could be some edge cases where this breaks existing tests.
