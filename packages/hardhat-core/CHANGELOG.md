This decision is based on the assumption that if the max reorganization block is greater than the latest block then there is a high probability that the fork is occurring on a devnet.
- 2b0ac92a3: Fixed an issue in the compilation pipeline where a valid build-info file was mistakenly deleted
- c0aa10c2d: Added support for solc 0.8.19 and 0.8.20

## 2.12.7

### Patch Changes

- e443b3667: Added an option in Hardhat Network to allow mining blocks with the same timestamp
- c23a1cac4: Added support for the `http_proxy` environment variable. When this variable is set, Hardhat will send its requests through the given proxy for things like JSON-RPC requests, mainnet forking and downloading compilers.

  We also removed support for the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables, since `http_proxy` is the most commonly used environment variable for this kind of thing. Those variables could only be used for downloading compilers.

  Finally, we also added support for `no_proxy`, which accepts a comma separated list of hosts or `"*"`. Any host included in this list will not be proxied.

  Note that requests to `"localhost"` or `"127.0.0.1"` are never proxied.

- 69546655e: Added support for sending batch requests through WebSocket to the Hardhat node (thanks @tenbits!)
